In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town\'s most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.<br /><br />Written in 1953, <i>The Crucible</i> is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy\'s ""witch-hunts"" in the United States.

Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911. <br /> <br />The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he\'s away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle\'s vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven\'t heard, spiking Mary\'s curiosity. <br /> <br />The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett\'s works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy. <br /> <br />The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world\'s major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child\'s journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood. One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children\'s literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance.

But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and poignant third installment of the beloved series.<br />--scholastic.com""), ('authors', OrderedDict([('author', OrderedDict([('id', '1077326'), ('name', 'J.K.

But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. <i>Little Women</i> brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the ""girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.</p>'), ('authors', OrderedDict([('author', OrderedDict([('id', '1315'), ('name', 'Louisa May Alcott'), ('role', None), ('image_url', OrderedDict([('@nophoto', 'false'), ('#text', 'https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1200326665p5/1315.jpg')])), ('small_image_url', OrderedDict([('@nophoto', 'false'), ('#text', 'https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1200326665p2/1315.jpg')])), ('link', 'https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1315.Louisa_May_Alcott'), ('average_rating', '4.06'), ('ratings_count', '1895168'), ('text_reviews_count', '42999')]))])), ('published', '2004'), ('work', OrderedDict([('id', '3244642'), ('uri', 'kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.d2eQgjlqgwEpanKeHkUAgw')]))])",4,,,Tue Jun 16 00:44:33 -0700 2020,Thu Jul 09 19:16:11 -0700 2020,https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3394610038,Little Women,1315,Louisa May Alcott,2020-07-09,2020-05-01,2020-05-01,2020-06-16,<tr><td><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3394610038'>Little Women</a></td></tr>

But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.<br /><br />Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.<br /><br /><i>Never Let Me Go</i> breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society.
